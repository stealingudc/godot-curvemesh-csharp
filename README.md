## godot-curvemesh-csharp
**Addon to generate customizable cylindrical meshes from 3D curves**
##### *This is a fork of [cloudofoz's plugin](https://github.com/cloudofoz/godot-curvemesh). All credits goes to them.*

This repository is a C# rewrite of the original "godot-curvemesh" plugin, for those who don't like Godot's cross-language scripting ["solution"](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/cross_language_scripting.html) (pfft, what is this, Node.js?)
